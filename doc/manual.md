## Introduction

Microsoft TileCode is a game creation app that allows you to design and play games directly on low-cost gaming handhelds or in a web browser. TileCode games are similar to board games with pieces that can move from one tile of the board to a nearby tile.

TileCode runs on any [MakeCode Arcade device](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware){:target="_blank"} - here are [detailed instructions](download) on how to download and copy the [TileCode UF2 file](https://github.com/microsoft/tilecode/releases/download/v4.2.8/arcade.uf2) file to your Arcade device. You also can run TileCode in the web-based MakeCode Arcade simulator at bottom of this screen or in a [separate tab](https://microsoft.github.io/tilecode/tilecode.html){:target="_blank"} - clicking on the lower right corner of the screen (arrow icon pointing down and to the right)  expands the game simulator to **full screen mode**. 

Both the UF2 file and the game simulator come loaded with six sample games. The game in slot #1 is a very simple example. The games in slots #4 - #8 are simplified versions of five popular games that together demonstrate all of TileCode's programming features.
